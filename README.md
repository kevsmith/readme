# Hello!

Welcome to the team! I'm excited to get to know you as we work together. This is a fast paced and fluid environment so it can take several weeks to get oriented. I know you're eager to make a good impression and rack up some accomplishments.

_Relax_. 

Take a deep breath. 

It will happen in time. You were hired because we have confidence in you and your skills. At first you should focus on getting to know the people, the product, and the company. Talk to folks. Take lots of notes. Ask lots of questions. Yes, even the dumb ones. 

**Especially** the dumb ones.

# This is...

...a user guide of sorts. It captures what you can expect working with me, what's important to me, and some of my "quirks". This guide is intended to give you an important puzzle piece and hopefully accelerate our working relationship.

# This Isn't...

...a description of my expectations for you or my plans for our organization and products. The guide is meant to be informational. If it helped you understand one part of your role (working with me) then it's done its job.

# About Me

I live in Raleigh, NC with my wife and 3 dogs. We have one daughter curently majoring in industrial design.

I've worked remotely, mostly for West Coast companies, for over 10 years and feel very comfortable working this way. Before managing full time I was a software engineer and worked mostly on backend and distributed systems. I have experience with a number of programming languages including Erlang, Elixir, SQL, Go, Python, and C/C++.

I still enjoy coding and try to have at least one or two side-projects active.

I've also done a lot of public speaking and enjoy helping others improve their speaking skills.

My pronouns are he/him.

# Leadership Style

**Leaders serve those they lead**. I subscribe to the [servant leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) school of thought. I believe the role of any leader is to serve the needs of those they lead. My job is to support and empower you and the team(s) you lead. Your job is to do the same for your team(s).

**"Leader" > "Manager"**. A person can manage others by wielding power conferred by organizational hierarchy to enforce their decisions. Those being managed have only two choices: follow or leave. This isn't leadership. True leadership requires the consent of those being led. It can only occur in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect.

**Leaders are ultimately responsible for team deliverables**. A good leader is constantly out in front of their team identifying problems and clearing obstacles. This allows the leader to adopt a more proactive stance leading to better results and fewer surprises.

# My Principles

**Execution is everything**. Businesses run on results. As engineers and leaders of engineers, we're judged on our collective ability to translate ideas into working systems. A team which has great plans and poor execution will rapidly lose credibility and influence. Companies stagnate and/or shut down when entire Engineering departments are unable to execute.

**"It's done when it's done" doesn't exist**. I like to see plans with rough estimates for any non-trivial project. I don't expect the plans to be 100% accurate but I need to know if something is going to take a few days, a few weeks, or longer. I use this information for outbound communication and to inform higher level planning.
 

# Communication

**Write stuff down**. 

**Explict trumps implicit every time**.

**Assume good intentions until proven otherwise**.

# Personal Quirks

**I'm an introvert**. I tend to be quiet in conversations while I'm absorbing information. Don't mistake my quietness for apathy or detachment.

**I ask a lot of questions**. This isn't an attempt to second-guess your work or challenge your decisions. I ask to help me understand your decisions and the thought process behind them.

**Work should be generally fun**. I believe laughing and having fun together makes teams stronger and happier.

**Dogs are clearly superior to cats**. ;-)
