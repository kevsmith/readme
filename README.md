# Greetings

Welcome to the team! I'm excited to get to know you as we work together. This is a fast paced and fluid environment so it can take several weeks to get oriented. I know you're eager to make a good impression and rack up some accomplishments.

_Relax_. 

Take a deep breath. 

It will happen in time. You were hired because we have confidence in you and your skills. At first you should focus on getting to know the people, the product, and the company. Talk to folks. Take lots of notes. Ask lots of questions. Yes, even the dumb ones. 

**Especially** the dumb ones.

# This is...

...a user guide of sorts. It captures what you can expect working with me, what's important to me, and some of my "quirks". This guide is intended to give you an important puzzle piece and hopefully accelerate our working relationship.

# This Isn't...

...a description of my expectations for you or my plans for our organization and products. The guide is meant to be informational. If it has helped you understand one part of your role (working with me) then it has done its job.

# About Me

I live in Raleigh, NC with my wife and 3 dogs. We have one daughter curently majoring in industrial design at university. I've worked remotely, mostly for West Coast companies, for over 10 years and feel very comfortable working this way. Before managing full time I was a software engineer and worked mostly on backend and distributed systems.

# Management Style

I subscribe to the [servant leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) school of thought. I believe the role of any leader is to serve the needs of those they lead. In my case my job is to support and empower you and the team(s) you manage.

# My Principles

**People first**.

**Autonomy**.

**Execution is everything**.

**Process should serve people**.
