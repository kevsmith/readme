# Hello!

Welcome to the team! I'm excited to get to know you as we work together. This is a fast paced and fluid environment so it can take several weeks to get oriented. I know you're eager to make a good impression and rack up some accomplishments.

_Relax_. 

Take a deep breath. 

It will happen in time. You were hired because we have confidence in you and your skills. At first you should focus on getting to know the people, the product, and the company. Talk to folks. Take lots of notes. Ask lots of questions. Yes, even the dumb ones. 

**Especially** the dumb ones.

# This is...

...a user guide of sorts. It captures what you can expect working with me, what's important to me, and some of my "quirks". This guide is intended to give you an important puzzle piece and hopefully accelerate our working relationship.

# This Isn't...

...a description of my expectations for you or my plans for our organization and products. The guide is meant to be informational. If it has helped you understand one part of your role (working with me) then it has done its job.

# About Me

I live in Raleigh, NC with my wife and 3 dogs. We have one daughter curently majoring in industrial design at university. 

I've worked remotely, mostly for West Coast companies, for over 10 years and feel very comfortable working this way. Before managing full time I was a software engineer and worked mostly on backend and distributed systems. 

I've also done a lot of public speaking and enjoy helping others improve their speaking skills.

My pronouns are he/him.

# Leadership Style

I subscribe to the [servant leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) school of thought. I believe the role of any leader is to serve the needs of those they lead. My job is to support and empower you and the team(s) you lead.

## Leader vs. Manager

I prefer _leader_ and _leadership_ to _manager_ and _management_. A person can manage others by using their power in the hierarchy to enforce their decisions. This isn't leadership. Those being managed have only two choices: follow or leave. True leadership requires the consent of those being led. It can only occur in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect.

# My Principles

**Execution is everything**.

**People first**.

**Autonomy**.

**Process should serve people**.

# Communication

# Personal Quirks

**I'm an introvert**. I tend to be quiet in conversations while I'm absorbing information. Don't mistake my quietness for apathy or detachment.

**I ask a lot of questions**. This isn't an attempt to second-guess your work or challenge your decisions. I ask to help me understand your decisions and the thought process behind them.

**I don't believe in "it's done when it's done"**. I like to see plans with rough estimates for any non-trivial project. I don't expect the plans to be 100% accurate but I need to know if something is going to take a few days, a few weeks, or longer. I use this information to accurately represent the team up and out to the rest of the company.

**Work should be generally fun**. I believe laughing and having fun together makes teams stronger and happier.

**Dogs are clearly superior to cats**. ;-)
